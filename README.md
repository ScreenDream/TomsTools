This repository is for the custom operators I create for Tooll3 (https://tooll.io)

Feel free to use and modify them however you want.
Discussion is best done via the Tooll3 Discord: https://discord.gg/PSn8GzNX

THESE are only tested by myself and often written for specific purposes, so they may or may not work for you!

Cheers,

Tom
